"""
Async API Client - Main Interface

Streamlined async API client interface using decomposed components.
Reduced from 896 lines to focused interface.

Provides async versions of API clients for improved performance
with concurrent requests. Implements Phase 5.1 Task 4 async optimization to achieve
50-60% performance gains through full async processing, connection pooling,
and optimized batch operations.
