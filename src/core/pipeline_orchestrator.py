"""Pipeline Orchestrator - Compatibility wrapper for modular architecture

DECOMPOSED: This file has been decomposed from 1,460 lines into modular components:
- orchestration/pipeline_orchestrator.py: Main coordinator (<200 lines)
- orchestration/workflow_engines/: Sequential, parallel, and AnyIO execution engines  
- orchestration/execution_monitors/: Progress, error, and performance monitoring
- orchestration/result_aggregators/: Simple and graph-based result aggregation

This wrapper maintains backward compatibility while providing improved modularity.
All original functionality is preserved in the new modular architecture.
