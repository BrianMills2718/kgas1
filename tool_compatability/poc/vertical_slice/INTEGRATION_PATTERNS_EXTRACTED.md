# Integration Patterns Extracted from Archived Plans
*Created: 2025-08-29*
*Purpose: Document valuable patterns extracted from integration plans before archiving*

## üîç **EXTRACTION SUMMARY**

Before archiving the integration plans, the following valuable architectural patterns and technical requirements were extracted and integrated into the authoritative architecture documents:

### **Patterns Extracted from VERTICAL_SLICE_INTEGRATION_PLAN_REVISED.md**

#### **1. Core Service-Tool Integration Pattern** ‚Üí Added to `VERTICAL_SLICE_20250826.md`
```
Framework ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Databases
         registers  use       access
```

**Key Insight**: Framework registers tools (not services directly). Tools wrap services to provide framework-compatible interface.

#### **2. Service Dependency Injection Pattern** ‚Üí Added to `SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION_SIMPLE.md`
```python
# Services initialized with dependencies
identity = IdentityServiceV3(neo4j_driver)
provenance = ProvenanceEnhanced('vertical_slice.db')
crossmodal = CrossModalService(neo4j_driver, 'vertical_slice.db')

# Tools receive services via constructor injection
persister = GraphPersisterV2(neo4j_driver, identity, crossmodal)
framework.register_tool(persister, capabilities)
```

### **Patterns Extracted from VERTICAL_SLICE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md**

#### **1. Infrastructure Requirements** ‚Üí Added to `VERTICAL_SLICE_20250826.md`
- **Dependencies**: sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, networkx, scikit-learn
- **Infrastructure**: Neo4j 5.13+, SQLite, 8GB RAM minimum
- **Database Config**: `bolt://localhost:7687`, `vertical_slice.db`

#### **2. Risk Mitigation Strategies** ‚Üí Added to `VERTICAL_SLICE_20250826.md`
- **Neo4j Vector Performance** ‚Üí FAISS fallback ready
- **Service Coupling** ‚Üí Keep loosely coupled interfaces
- **Tool Chain Complexity** ‚Üí Start simple, add incrementally
- **Scope Creep** ‚Üí Stick to MVP features
- **Integration Issues** ‚Üí Test incrementally with checkpoints

## ‚úÖ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE**

### **Authoritative Documents Updated**:

#### **VERTICAL_SLICE_20250826.md Enhanced With**:
- Core integration pattern visualization
- Service-tool wrapper pattern with code example
- Complete infrastructure requirements
- Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies

#### **SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION_SIMPLE.md Enhanced With**:
- Service dependency injection pattern
- Tool registration with service dependencies
- Complete service initialization example

### **What Was Archived**:
- Implementation timelines and project management content
- Phase-by-phase development roadmaps
- Day-by-day task breakdowns
- Specific implementation scripts and test cases

### **What Was Preserved**:
- **Architectural patterns** that define system structure
- **Technical requirements** for infrastructure and dependencies  
- **Integration strategies** for service coordination
- **Risk mitigation approaches** for technical challenges

## üìã **RESULT**

The authoritative architecture documents now contain all valuable technical patterns from the integration plans, while the implementation-specific content has been appropriately archived. This maintains the target state focus of architecture documentation while preserving essential integration knowledge.

**Next Step**: The integration plans can now be safely archived since all architectural value has been extracted and integrated into the canonical documents.
