**Content Assessment**:
- Detailed architecture for different theory component types
- Level 1 (FORMULAS) marked as "FULLY IMPLEMENTED"
- Levels 2-6 have complete architectural designs
- No conflicts with current architecture - extends existing capabilities
- Implementation phases and technical requirements specified

### **‚úÖ 3. WorkflowDAG Specification** - **READY FOR EXTRACTION**  
**Source**: `/docs/architecture/KGAS_FULL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` (WorkflowDAG sections)
**Target**: `/docs/architecture/systems/workflow-orchestration.md`
**Value**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **HIGH** - Core orchestration capability
**Status**: Complete implementation with sequential/parallel/conditional patterns

**Content Assessment**:
- WorkflowDAG class with dependency resolution
- Sequential, parallel, conditional workflow patterns
- Execution patterns with checkpoint recovery
- State management architecture
- No conflicts - complements existing tool framework

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED**

### **CONFLICT 1: System Purpose & Vision**

**Current ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md**:
- "Theory automation proof-of-concept for future LLM capabilities"  
- "Not a general research tool for human researchers"
- Focus on preparing for future autonomous LLM research

**Extracted KGAS_FULL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md**:  
- "Operationalizes theory-first computational social science"
- Complete production system specification
- Focus on current implementation with dynamic tool generation

**UNCERTAINTY**: Which vision is correct? Future proof-of-concept vs current production system?
**REQUIRES USER CLARIFICATION**: This affects all subsequent architectural decisions

### **CONFLICT 2: Tool Generation Philosophy**

**Current Architecture**:
- 122+ specialized tools available for LLM selection
- Pre-built tools in tool registry
- Tool-based ecosystem approach

**Extracted Architecture**:
- "Tools are NOT pre-built. They are GENERATED from theory schemas extracted by LLMs"  
- Dynamic tool generation from academic papers
- Runtime compilation and registration

**UNCERTAINTY**: Pre-built tools vs dynamic generation? Both approaches present?
**REQUIRES USER CLARIFICATION**: Fundamental difference in system operation

### **CONFLICT 3: Cross-Modal Analysis Approach**

**Current Architecture**:
- Cross-modal conversion between graph/table/vector formats
- Uncertainty-aware integration for future LLM confidence assessment

**Extracted Architecture**:
- 6 Tool Suites with Cross-Modal Converters
- Complete cross-modal workflow orchestration
- Theory-guided data routing between modalities

**UNCERTAINTY**: Simple conversion vs comprehensive routing architecture?
**REQUIRES USER CLARIFICATION**: Scope and complexity level

## üìù **VALUABLE CONTENT FOR FUTURE WRITING**

### **Academic Writing & Proposal Materials** - **KEEP**
**Value for User's Future Writing Tasks**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **ESSENTIAL**

**Proposal Writing Guidance**:
- `/docs/architecture/proposal_rewrite/CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive dissertation proposal writing standards
- Tense usage, terminology preferences, scope management
- 15,000 word target length guidance
- RAND style guide compliance

**Uncertainty Framework Design**:
- `/docs/architecture/proposal_rewrite/full_example/OVERVIEW.md` - Complete uncertainty system design
- Expert reasoning trace systems
- Dempster-Shafer evidence combination
- Theory application methodology

**Academic Positioning**:
- Success criteria and validation frameworks
- Theory automation levels (80%+ extraction accuracy targets)
- Performance benchmarks and quality metrics

**Recommendation**: Move entire proposal_rewrite directory to main project directory (outside docs) as requested

---

## üö´ **CONTENT FOR ARCHIVAL**

### **Working Materials & Drafts**
- `/docs/architecture/proposal_rewrite/full_example/archive/` - Working exploration files
- `/docs/architecture/proposal_rewrite/proposal_old/` - Historical proposal versions  
- `/docs/architecture/proposal_rewrite_condensed/full_example/archive/` - Draft materials

### **Superseded Planning**
- Multiple uncertainty approach explorations (now consolidated)
- Various DAG execution examples (working drafts)
- Historical proposal iterations

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED EXTRACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Safe Extractions** (No Conflicts)
1. ‚úÖ **Theory Meta-Schema v13** ‚Üí `/specifications/theory-schemas.md`
2. ‚úÖ **Six-Level Automation** ‚Üí `/systems/theory-automation.md`  
3. ‚úÖ **WorkflowDAG** ‚Üí `/systems/workflow-orchestration.md`

### **Phase 2: Conflict Resolution** (Requires User Clarification)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Merge Architecture Overviews** ‚Üí Single authoritative `/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
   - **USER DECISION NEEDED**: System vision (proof-of-concept vs production)
   - **USER DECISION NEEDED**: Tool philosophy (pre-built vs dynamic generation)
   - **USER DECISION NEEDED**: Cross-modal complexity level

### **Phase 3: Content Organization**  
5. ‚úÖ **Move Proposal Materials** ‚Üí `/proposal_materials/` (outside docs, as requested)
6. ‚úÖ **Archive Working Drafts** ‚Üí Archive directory

## ‚ö° **NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRING USER DECISIONS**

1. **Architecture Conflict Resolution**: Which system vision should be canonical?
2. **Tool Generation Philosophy**: Pre-built tools, dynamic generation, or both?
3. **Cross-Modal Complexity**: Simple conversion or comprehensive orchestration?

**These decisions will determine how to merge competing architectures into single authoritative documentation.**
