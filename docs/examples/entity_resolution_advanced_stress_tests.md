# Advanced Stress Tests for Balanced Entity Resolution Framework

## Testing New Edge Cases and Failure Modes

These tests examine scenarios that could reveal additional limitations or require framework adjustments.

## Test 1: Gradual Entity Evolution

### Scenario: Political Party Transformation
```
2010: "We in the Tea Party movement stand for fiscal conservatism."
2012: "We've joined forces with establishment Republicans."
2014: "We are now the dominant force within the Republican Party."
2016: "We Republicans embrace the populist message."
2018: "We've transformed the party completely."
```

### Framework Behavior
```python
# Each processed independently with temporal markers
{
  "2010": {"entity": "Tea_Party", "temporal": "past"},
  "2012": {"entity": "Tea_Party", "temporal": "past"},
  "2014": {"entity_distribution": {"Tea_Party": 0.5, "Republicans": 0.5}, "temporal": "past"},
  "2016": {"entity": "Republicans", "temporal": "past"},
  "2018": {"entity": "Republicans", "temporal": "present"}
}
```

### Problem Revealed
- Framework captures temporal markers but not evolution
- Can't model the gradual transformation from Tea Party to Republican mainstream
- Each timepoint treated independently

### Potential Enhancement
```python
class EvolutionAwareEntity:
    """Track entity transformation patterns"""
    entity_timeline: List[Tuple[str, str, float]]  # (date, entity, confidence)
    transformation_events: List[str]  # "merger", "absorption", "split"
```

## Test 2: Code-Switching Scenarios

### Scenario: Bilingual Political Speech
```
"We need to unite our community. Nosotros somos fuertes juntos. They don't understand nuestra cultura. When we vote, cuando votamos unidos, they see our power."
```

### Framework Behavior
```python
# Attempts to process mixed language
{
  "instances": [
    {"text": "We", "entity": "Latino_Community", "confidence": 0.7},
    {"text": "Nosotros", "entity": "Latino_Community", "confidence": 0.8},
    {"text": "They", "entity_distribution": {"Non_Latinos": 0.6, "Politicians": 0.4}},
    {"text": "nuestra", "entity": "Latino_Community", "confidence": 0.9},
    {"text": "we", "entity": "Latino_Community", "confidence": 0.8},
    {"text": "they", "entity": "Non_Latino_Voters", "confidence": 0.6}
  ]
}
```

### Issues
- Same entity referenced in multiple languages
- Cultural context affects entity interpretation
- "They" changes meaning based on language context

## Test 3: Nested Organizational Hierarchies

### Scenario: Corporate Email Chain
```
Email_1 (CEO): "We need to cut costs across the company."
Email_2 (VP_Sales): "We in sales have already reduced expenses. We can't cut more."
Email_3 (Regional_Manager): "We've done what we can. They at corporate don't understand."
Email_4 (Sales_Rep): "We're already stretched thin. They keep demanding more."
```

### Framework Challenge
```python
# Multiple valid "we" interpretations per speaker
{
  "VP_Sales": {
    "we_1": "Sales_Department",  # "We in sales"
    "we_2": "Company_Leadership"  # Implied by responding to CEO
  },
  "Regional_Manager": {
    "we": "Regional_Team",
    "they": "Corporate_Leadership"  # But Regional is part of corporate!
  }
}
```

### Limitation Exposed
- Same speaker uses "we" for different nested groups
- Hierarchical relationships not captured
- "They" can refer to parent organization

## Test 4: Sarcasm and Irony

### Scenario: Parliamentary Debate
```
MP_A: "Oh yes, 'we' certainly care about the working class, don't we?" 
MP_B: "When my colleague says 'we', I assume he means his banker friends."
MP_A: "They always twist our words. We know who really represents the people."
```

### Framework Behavior
```python
# Treats sarcastic "we" as genuine reference
{
  "MP_A_utterance_1": {
    "we": {"entity": "Conservative_Party", "confidence": 0.8}  # Missing sarcasm
  },
  "MP_B_response": {
    "meta_commentary": true,  # Correctly identified
    "reframes_we_as": "Banker_Friends"
  }
}
```

### Problem
- Can't distinguish sarcastic from genuine group claims
- Ironic distancing not captured
- May analyze sarcastic claims as real positions

## Test 5: Reported Speech and Quotations

### Scenario: News Article
```
The minister said, "We will not negotiate with them." However, sources report that "they have already begun talks with us." When asked, officials stated "We don't comment on 'their' claims about 'our' supposed negotiations."
```

### Framework Confusion
```python
# Mixed speaker attributions
{
  "instances": [
    {"text": "We", "speaker": "minister", "entity": "Government"},
    {"text": "they", "speaker": "sources", "entity": "Government"},  # Perspective shift
    {"text": "us", "speaker": "sources", "entity": "Opposition"},
    {"text": "We", "speaker": "officials", "entity": "Government"},
    {"text": "their", "speaker": "officials", "entity": "Sources"},  # Meta-reference
    {"text": "our", "speaker": "officials", "entity": "Government"}
  ]
}
```

### Issues
- Nested quotations create speaker ambiguity
- Perspective shifts within same sentence
- Meta-references to other speakers' claims

## Test 6: Group Merger and Split Dynamics

### Scenario: Political Realignment
```
Day 1: "We progressives and we moderates must unite against them."
Day 30: "We've formed a coalition. They couldn't divide us."
Day 60: "We were united, but they've found our weakness."
Day 90: "We progressives can no longer work with them, the former moderates."
```

### Framework Limitation
```python
# Can't track relationship changes
{
  "Day_1": {
    "we_progressives": "Progressive_Group",
    "we_moderates": "Moderate_Group",
    "them": "Opposition"
  },
  "Day_90": {
    "we": "Progressive_Group",
    "them": "Moderate_Group"  # Former allies now opposition!
  }
}
```

### Problem
- Static entity relationships
- Can't model alliance → merger → split
- Historical context lost

## Test 7: Hypothetical and Conditional References

### Scenario: Strategic Planning
```
"If we align with them, then they would help us. But if we don't, they might join them against us. When we consider what they might do, we must think about their options."
```

### Framework Behavior
```python
# Treats all references as factual
{
  "instances": [
    {"text": "we", "entity": "Our_Group", "confidence": 0.9},
    {"text": "them", "entity": "Potential_Ally", "confidence": 0.6},
    {"text": "they", "entity": "Potential_Ally", "confidence": 0.6},
    {"text": "us", "entity": "Our_Group", "confidence": 0.9}
    # Loses hypothetical nature
  ]
}
```

### Missing Context
- Conditional relationships not captured
- Hypothetical scenarios treated as real
- Strategic ambiguity lost

## Test 8: Document Scale Breakdown

### Scenario: 500-Page Congressional Record
```
Page 1: "We Republicans propose..."
Page 50: "They suggested earlier..."  # Refers to page 1
Page 200: "As we discussed..."  # Refers to page 50
Page 499: "Their original proposal..."  # Refers to page 1
```

### Framework Failure
- 10-unit context window can't span 500 pages
- Long-range coreferences become disconnected
- Degrades to mostly UNKNOWN entities

### Scalability Limit
```python
def assess_document_suitability(doc):
    if doc.length > 10000:  # words
        return "Framework degrades significantly"
    if doc.reference_span > 100:  # units between coreferent mentions
        return "Long-range coreference lost"
```

## Test 9: Dense Technical Language

### Scenario: Legal Contract
```
"The Party of the First Part (hereinafter 'We') agrees with the Party of the Second Part (hereinafter 'They') that We shall indemnify Them against claims by Third Parties (hereinafter 'Others')."
```

### Framework Confusion
```python
# Legal definitions create rigid mappings
{
  "defined_entities": {
    "We": "Party_First_Part",
    "They": "Party_Second_Part",  
    "Others": "Third_Parties"
  },
  # But framework doesn't understand these are definitions
  "extracted": [
    {"text": "We", "entity_distribution": {"Unknown": 0.5, "Contract_Parties": 0.5}}
  ]
}
```

### Problem
- Explicit definitions not recognized as special
- Legal precision requirements not met
- Technical domains need different handling

## Test 10: Mixed Communication Modes

### Scenario: Slack + Email + Meeting Transcript
```
Slack: "We need to discuss the proposal"
Email: "Following up on what they said in Slack..."
Meeting: "When they emailed about our proposal..."
Slack: "They misunderstood what we meant"
```

### Framework Limitation
- Each document processed independently
- Cross-medium coreference impossible
- Conversation threading lost

## Analysis of Advanced Stress Tests

### New Limitations Discovered

1. **Evolution Blindness**: Can't track gradual entity transformation
2. **Code-Switch Confusion**: Same entity in multiple languages treated separately
3. **Hierarchy Flattening**: Nested organizational levels collapsed
4. **Sarcasm Literalism**: Ironic usage taken at face value
5. **Quote Attribution Errors**: Reported speech creates speaker confusion
6. **Relationship Stasis**: Can't model changing alliances
7. **Modality Blindness**: Hypotheticals treated as factual
8. **Scale Degradation**: Performance drops drastically in long documents
9. **Domain Specificity**: Technical language needs special handling
10. **Medium Isolation**: Can't track across communication channels

### Proposed Enhancements

#### Minimal Additions for Maximum Impact

1. **Evolution Markers**
```python
class EntityEvolution:
    transformation_type: Literal["merger", "split", "absorption", "gradual"]
    confidence: float
```

2. **Modality Flags**
```python
class ModalityAwareInstance:
    modality: Literal["factual", "hypothetical", "sarcastic", "reported"]
```

3. **Hierarchy Hints**
```python
class HierarchicalEntity:
    level: int  # Organizational level
    parent: Optional[str]  # Parent organization
```

### When to Use Alternative Approaches

Based on these stress tests, use different frameworks for:

1. **Historical Evolution Studies**: Need dedicated temporal modeling
2. **Multi-language Corpora**: Require multilingual entity linking
3. **Legal/Technical Documents**: Need precision and definition handling
4. **Long Documents (>10k words)**: Require different architecture
5. **Cross-media Analysis**: Need conversation threading systems

### Validation Requirements

Before deploying, validate:

1. **Scale Testing**: Document length vs. quality degradation curve
2. **Domain Testing**: Performance across different text types
3. **Language Testing**: Monolingual vs. multilingual performance
4. **Temporal Testing**: How far back can references reach?
5. **Speaker Testing**: Maximum viable speaker count

## Conclusion

These advanced stress tests reveal that while our balanced framework handles basic cases well, many real-world scenarios require either:

1. Additional minimal enhancements (modality flags, evolution markers)
2. Different frameworks entirely (legal precision, historical evolution)
3. Clear documentation of limitations (scale, domain, medium)

The key insight: **No single framework can handle all entity resolution needs**. The goal should be a toolkit of approaches with clear guidance on when to use each.
