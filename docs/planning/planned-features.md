# Planned Features - NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Everything in this document represents **future development goals**, not current capabilities. 

**This file is aspirational; see ROADMAP_v2.1.md for committed scope.**

**Current Reality**: See [`docs/planning/roadmap.md`](../planning/roadmap.md) for what actually works.

## 🎯 Long-term Vision (Aspirational)

### Format-Agnostic Analytics (post-GraphRAG)
A system that intelligently processes diverse data sources through format-agnostic analysis, using specialized tools to dynamically select optimal data structures and enable sophisticated multi-step analytical workflows.

**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Current system only handles PDF → Graph extraction

### 121-Tool Ecosystem (Future Goal)
Complete toolkit spanning 8 phases of data processing, from ingestion through analysis to export.

**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Currently ~23 Python files, mostly in Phase 1

## 📋 Planned Tool Phases (Future Development)

### Phase 1: Ingestion (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Multi-format data loading and API connectors
- ✅ **T01**: PDF Loader (working)
- ✅ **T15a**: Text Chunker (working)  
- ❌ **T02-T12**: Other ingestion tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 2: Processing (BROKEN/INCOMPLETE)
**Goal**: NLP, entity extraction, format detection
- ✅ **T23a**: spaCy NER (working in Phase 1)
- ⚠️ **T23c**: Ontology-aware extraction (partial due to integration challenges)
- ❌ **T13-T30**: Other processing tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 3: Construction (STANDALONE ONLY)
**Goal**: Dynamic structure building (graphs, tables, embeddings)
- 🔧 **T301**: Multi-document fusion tools (standalone, not integrated)
- ❌ **T31-T48**: Other construction tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 4: Retrieval (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Cross-format querying and data access
- ❌ **T49-T67**: All retrieval tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 5: Analysis (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Format-specific algorithms (graph, statistical, vector)
- ❌ **T68-T75**: All analysis tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 6: Storage (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Multi-database management, backup, caching
- ❌ **T76-T81**: All storage tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 7: Interface (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Natural language processing, monitoring, export
- ❌ **T82-T106**: All interface tools (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

### Phase 8: Core Services (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Goal**: Identity, versioning, quality tracking, workflow state
- ✅ **T107, T110, T111, T121**: Some core services (working)
- ❌ **T108, T109, T112-T120**: Other core services (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

## 🌟 Planned Capabilities (Future Goals)

### Format-Agnostic Processing (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision**: Accept PDFs, CSVs, APIs, databases and automatically adapt processing
**Current Reality**: Only PDF processing implemented

### Dynamic Structure Selection (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision**: AI chooses graphs for relationships, tables for statistics, vectors for similarity
**Current Reality**: Only graph extraction implemented

### Seamless Format Conversion (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision**: Tools like T115 (Graph→Table) and T116 (Table→Graph) enable mid-workflow format changes
**Current Reality**: No format conversion tools exist

### Multi-Format Workflows (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
**Vision Example**:
```
Research Papers (PDF) → Text → Entities → Citation Graph → PageRank → 
Top Authors (Table) → Statistical Analysis → Geographic Clustering → 
Collaboration Network (Graph) → Community Detection → Summary Report
```
**Current Reality**: Can only do: PDF → Text → Entities → Graph

## 🚨 Implementation Requirements Before These Become Reality

### 1. Fix Current Integration Issues
- [ ] Resolve Phase 1→2 API compatibility problems
- [ ] Create standard phase interface contracts
- [ ] Implement automated integration testing

### 2. Build Architecture Foundation
- [ ] Service versioning strategy
- [ ] Backward compatibility layers
- [ ] UI adapter pattern for phase differences

### 3. Systematic Implementation
- [ ] Implement tools incrementally with integration testing
- [ ] Verify each tool works before documenting as "complete"
- [ ] Create real validation commands for all claims

### 4. Quality Assurance
- [ ] End-to-end testing framework
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Error handling and recovery procedures

## 📋 Development Principles for Future Work

### Verification-First Implementation
```bash
# Before claiming any tool is implemented:
python -c "from src.tools.phaseX.tXX_tool import Tool; print(Tool().execute(test_input))"

# Before claiming integration works:
python test_integration.py --phase1-to-phase2

# Before updating documentation:
python verify_all_claims.py
```

### Reality-Based Progress Tracking
- **Document what exists**, not what's planned
- **Test integration** before claiming phases work together  
- **Verify UI functionality** before marking features as available
- **Separate aspirational content** from implementation claims
