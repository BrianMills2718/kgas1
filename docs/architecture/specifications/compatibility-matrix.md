# Compatibility Matrix

## Core Data Types

All data types inherit from BaseObject and include quality tracking:

### 1. BaseObject (Foundation for all types)
```python
{
    # Identity
    "id": str,              # Unique identifier
    "object_type": str,     # Entity, Relationship, Chunk, etc.
    
    # Quality (REQUIRED for all objects)
    "confidence": float,    # 0.0 to 1.0
    "quality_tier": str,    # "high", "medium", "low"
    
    # Provenance (REQUIRED)
    "created_by": str,      # Tool that created this
    "created_at": datetime,
    "workflow_id": str,

## Critical Tool Chains

### 1. Document to Knowledge Graph (Most Common)
```
T01/T05/T06 (Ingestion) 
    ↓ [Document with initial confidence] → SQLite storage
T15a/b (Chunking)
    ↓ [Chunks inherit document confidence] → SQLite storage
T23a/b (Entity/Relationship Extraction)
    ↓ [Mentions with extraction confidence] → SQLite storage
T28 (Entity Confidence Scoring)
    ↓ [Enhanced confidence scores]

    ↓ [Only high-confidence results]
T51 (Local Search)
    ↓ [Subgraph of quality entities]
T57 (Answer Generation)
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Every Tool MUST:
1. Accept and propagate confidence scores
2. Use reference-based I/O (never full objects)
3. Record provenance via T110
4. Support quality filtering
5. Work with partial data

### Core Services Integration:
- T107-T111 must be implemented FIRST
- All other tools depend on these services
- No tool bypasses the identity/quality system

### Data Flow Rules:
1. Confidence only decreases (or stays same)
2. Quality tier can be upgraded only with evidence
3. Provenance is append-only
4. References are immutable

## Tool Contract Specifications

### Programmatic Contract Verification

All tool contracts are defined in structured, machine-readable formats (YAML/JSON) to enable automated validation. This aims to catch compatibility issues early in the development cycle, enforce data integrity, and ensure consistency across the 121-tool vision.

**How it Works:**

1. **Schema-Driven Definitions**: Data models (e.g., Document, Entity, Relationship) are defined using Pydantic, which directly reflects the ORM-based conceptual schema and Master Concept Library standards.

2. **Runtime Validation**: Tools leverage Pydantic's capabilities for runtime validation, ensuring all inputs and outputs strictly conform to their defined types and attributes.

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests for contract compliance are a required part of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. No code that breaks a contract can be merged.

4. **Dedicated Contract Tests**: A dedicated suite of tests verifies each tool's adherence to its input/output contracts and state changes.

**Implementation Location**: See `/_schemas/theory_meta_schema_v10.json` for the formal contract schema definition.

### Contract-Based Tool Selection

Tools declare contracts that specify:
1. **Required Attributes**: What data fields must exist
2. **Required State**: What processing must have occurred
3. **Produced Attributes**: What the tool creates
4. **State Changes**: How the tool changes workflow state
5. **Error Codes**: Structured error reporting

### Example: Entity Resolution Chain

```python
# T23b Contract (Entity/Relationship Extractor)
{
    "required_state": {
        "chunks_created": true,
        "entities_resolved": false  # Can work without resolution
    },
    "produced_state": {
        "mentions_created": true,
        "relationships_extracted": true
    }
}

# T25 Contract (Coreference Resolver)
{
    "required_state": {
        "mentions_created": true,
        "entities_resolved": "optional"  # Adapts based on domain
    },
    "produced_state": {
        "coreferences_resolved": true
    }
}

# T31 Contract (Entity Node Builder)
{
    "required_state": {
        "mentions_created": true,
        "entities_resolved": "optional"  # Domain choice
    },
    "produced_state": {
        "entities_created": true,
        "graph_ready": true
    }
}
```

### Domain-Specific Resolution

Entity resolution is now optional based on analytical needs:

#### Social Network Analysis (No Resolution)
```python
# Keep @obama and @barackobama as separate entities
workflow_config = {
    "resolve_entities": false,
    "reason": "Track separate social media identities"
}
```

#### Corporate Analysis (With Resolution)
```python
# Merge "Apple Inc.", "Apple Computer", "AAPL"
workflow_config = {
    "resolve_entities": true,
    "reason": "Unified corporate entity analysis"
}
```

### Contract Validation

Before executing any tool:
1. Check required_attributes exist in input data
2. Verify required_state matches current workflow state
3. Ensure resources available for performance requirements
4. Plan error handling based on declared error codes

This contract system enables:
- Automatic tool selection based on current state
- Intelligent error recovery with alternative tools
- Domain-adaptive workflows
- Pre-flight validation before execution

## Database Integration Requirements

### Storage Distribution Strategy
- **Neo4j**: Entities, relationships, communities, graph structure
- **SQLite**: Mentions, documents, chunks, workflow state, provenance, quality scores
- **Neo4j Vector Index**: Entity embeddings, chunk embeddings, similarity search within Neo4j

### Reference Resolution System
All tools must use the universal reference format:
```
neo4j://entity/ent_12345
sqlite://mention/mention_67890  
neo4j://entity/ent_vector_54321
```

### Quality Tracking Integration
Every database operation must:
1. Preserve confidence scores
2. Update quality metadata
3. Record provenance via T110
4. Support quality filtering

### Transaction Coordination
Multi-database operations require:
1. Neo4j vector index operations are ACID-compliant within the same transaction
2. Neo4j and SQLite in coordinated transactions
3. Rollback procedures for partial failures
4. Integrity validation across databases

### Performance Requirements
- Reference resolution: <10ms for single objects
- Batch operations: Handle 1000+ objects efficiently
- Search operations: Sub-second response times
- Quality propagation: Async for large dependency chains

### Error Recovery
- Checkpoint workflow state every 100 operations
- Validate reference integrity on startup
- Support partial result recovery
- Log database-specific errors with context

## Integration Testing Requirements

### Multi-Database Workflows
Test complete data flows across all three databases:
1. Document → SQLite → Entity extraction → Neo4j (graph + embeddings)
2. Query → Neo4j vector search → Neo4j enrichment → SQLite provenance
3. Analysis → Neo4j algorithms → Statistical conversion → Results storage

### Consistency Validation
Regular checks for:
- Orphaned references between databases
- Quality score consistency
- Provenance chain completeness
- Version synchronization

### Performance Benchmarks
- 10MB PDF processing: <2 minutes end-to-end
- 1000 entity search: <1 second
- Graph analysis (10K nodes): <30 seconds
- Quality propagation (1000 objects): <5 seconds

## Schema Validation and Consistency

### Pydantic Models
All data types are implemented as Pydantic models for runtime validation:

```python
# src/models/base.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class BaseObject(BaseModel):
    """Base model for all KGAS objects"""
    id: str = Field(..., regex="^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$")
    object_type: str
    confidence: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    quality_tier: str = Field(..., regex="^(high|medium|low)$")
    created_by: str
    created_at: datetime
    workflow_id: str
    version: int = Field(default=1, ge=1)
    warnings: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    evidence: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    source_refs: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    
    @validator('confidence')
    def validate_confidence(cls, v):
        if not 0.0 <= v <= 1.0:
            raise ValueError('Confidence must be between 0.0 and 1.0')
        return v

    class Config:
        json_encoders = {
            datetime: lambda v: v.isoformat()
        }
```

### Schema Registry
Central registry ensures consistency across all tools:

```python
# src/core/schema_registry.py
class SchemaRegistry:
    """Central schema registry for data consistency"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.schemas = {}
        self._load_core_schemas()
    
    def register_schema(self, name: str, schema: Type[BaseModel]):
        """Register a schema for validation"""
        self.schemas[name] = schema
    
    def validate(self, object_type: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> BaseModel:
        """Validate data against registered schema"""
        if object_type not in self.schemas:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown object type: {object_type}")
        
        schema = self.schemas[object_type]
        return schema(**data)  # Pydantic validation
    
    def get_schema_json(self, object_type: str) -> Dict:
        """Get JSON schema for object type"""
        schema = self.schemas[object_type]
        return schema.schema()
```

### Cross-Schema Consistency Rules

#### 1. Reference Integrity
- All `*_ref` fields must reference existing objects
- References use consistent format: `{store}://{type}/{id}`
- Orphaned references are detected and reported

#### 2. Confidence Propagation
- Child objects cannot have higher confidence than parents
- Aggregated confidence uses minimum of components
- Confidence decay is monotonic through pipelines

#### 3. MCL Alignment
- All entity types map to Master Concept Library
- New concepts require MCL review process
- Mappings include confidence scores

#### 4. Temporal Consistency
- All timestamps use ISO 8601 format
- Created_at < modified_at invariant
- Version numbers increment monotonically

### Schema Evolution Process

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - New fields are optional with defaults
   - Field removal requires deprecation period
   - Type changes require migration scripts

2. **Version Management**
   ```python
   class SchemaVersion:
       version: str = "1.0.0"
       compatible_versions: List[str] = ["0.9.0", "0.9.1"]
       migration_required: List[str] = ["0.8.x"]
   ```

3. **Migration Support**
   ```python
   def migrate_v1_to_v2(old_data: Dict) -> Dict:
       """Migrate schema from v1 to v2"""
       new_data = old_data.copy()
       # Add new required fields with defaults
       new_data['mcl_mapping'] = {
           'mcl_id': 'unknown',
           'confidence': 0.5
       }
       return new_data
   ```

### Validation in CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/schema-validation.yml
schema-validation:
  steps:
    - name: Validate Schema Consistency
      run: |
        python scripts/validate_schemas.py
        
    - name: Check Schema Coverage
      run: |
        python scripts/check_schema_coverage.py
        
    - name: Test Schema Migrations
      run: |
        pytest tests/schema/test_migrations.py
```

### Common Schema Violations and Fixes

| Violation | Example | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Missing confidence | `{"name": "Entity"}` | Add `"confidence": 0.95` |
| Invalid reference | `"ref": "entity123"` | Use `"ref": "neo4j://entity/entity123"` |
| Type mismatch | `"position": "5"` | Use `"position": 5` (integer) |
| Missing provenance | No created_by | Add `"created_by": "T23a"` |

This matrix supersedes all previous compatibility documentation and aligns with the 121-tool architecture defined in SPECIFICATIONS.md, with enhanced schema validation ensuring data consistency across all tools.
