# ADR-011: Academic Research Focus

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Updated**: 2025-07-29  
**Context**: This is a proof-of-concept academic exercise to demonstrate the power of LLMs to automate and scale theoretically and empirically informed discourse-driven computational social science in an era of rapidly improving LLMs.

## Decision

We will design KGAS as an **LLM-powered computational social science proof-of-concept** that demonstrates:

1. **LLM-driven development**: Built using AI coding tools to showcase LLM development capabilities
2. **Theoretical automation**: Automated theory extraction and application using modern LLMs
3. **Empirical integration**: LLM-intelligent discourse analysis with uncertainty quantification
4. **Research scalability**: From hundreds to thousands of documents using LLM intelligence
5. **Methodological innovation**: New approaches possible only with sophisticated LLM capabilities

```python
# LLM-powered proof-of-concept principles
class LLMComputationalSocialScience:
    def __init__(self):
        self.demonstration_goals = [
            "llm_development_capability",  # Show LLMs can build sophisticated systems
            "theoretical_automation",     # Automate theory extraction from literature
            "discourse_intelligence",     # LLM-powered discourse analysis at scale
            "methodological_innovation",  # Enable new research approaches
            "research_democratization",   # Make advanced analysis accessible
            "proof_of_concept_validity"   # Demonstrate feasibility of LLM-driven research
        ]
        
        self.complexity_philosophy = "sophisticated_backend_simple_interface"
        self.development_approach = "llm_assisted_rapid_prototyping"
```

## Rationale

### **Why Academic Research Focus?**

**1. Research Requirements Are Unique**:
- **Methodological rigor**: Every processing step must be documented and justifiable
- **Reproducibility**: Complete workflows must be repeatable by other researchers
- **Domain flexibility**: Must support diverse social science theories and approaches
- **Citation integrity**: Every extracted fact must be traceable to original sources
- **Epistemic humility**: Must acknowledge and track uncertainty appropriately

**2. Academic vs. Enterprise Trade-offs**:

| Requirement | Academic Research | Enterprise Production |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Correctness** | Critical - wrong results invalidate months of work | Important - but can be iterated |
| **Performance** | Secondary - researchers work with smaller datasets | Critical - must handle high throughput |
| **Scalability** | Local - single researcher, 10-1000 documents | Enterprise - thousands of users, millions of documents |
| **Flexibility** | Critical - must support novel research approaches | Secondary - standardized business processes |
| **Security** | Appropriate - local research environment | Critical - enterprise security requirements |
| **Monitoring** | Academic - research validation focus | Enterprise - uptime and performance focus |

**3. Research Environment Constraints**:
- **Local deployment**: Researchers work on personal/institutional computers
- **Single-node processing**: No distributed infrastructure available
- **Limited technical expertise**: Researchers are domain experts, not DevOps engineers
- **Intermittent usage**: Used for specific research projects, not 24/7 operations

### **Why Not Enterprise Production Focus?**

**Enterprise production requirements would force compromises incompatible with research**:

**1. Performance over correctness**: Enterprise systems optimize for throughput, potentially sacrificing accuracy for speed
**2. Standardization over flexibility**: Enterprise systems standardize processes, limiting research methodology innovation
**3. Infrastructure complexity**: Enterprise scalability requires distributed systems expertise beyond typical research environments
**4. Security overhead**: Enterprise security adds complexity inappropriate for local research use

## Alternatives Considered

### **1. Enterprise Production Tool**
**Rejected because**:
- **Performance focus**: Would prioritize speed over research accuracy requirements
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Would require database servers, distributed systems, DevOps expertise
- **Standardized workflows**: Would limit research methodology flexibility
- **Security complexity**: Would add inappropriate complexity for local research environments

### **2. Hybrid Academic/Enterprise Tool**
**Rejected because**:
- **Conflicting priorities**: Cannot optimize for both research correctness and enterprise performance
- **Feature complexity**: Would create confusing interfaces trying to serve both audiences
- **Maintenance overhead**: Would require maintaining two different optimization paths
- **Focus dilution**: Would compromise excellence in either domain

### **3. Enterprise Tool with Academic Add-ons**
**Rejected because**:
- **Core architecture mismatch**: Enterprise foundations incompatible with research transparency needs
- **Academic features as afterthought**: Research requirements become secondary considerations
- **Deployment complexity**: Enterprise infrastructure requirements inappropriate for research

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Research excellence**: Optimized for academic research requirements and workflows
- **Methodological integrity**: Supports rigorous research methodologies and citation practices
- **Local deployment**: Simple setup for individual researchers
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to diverse research approaches and novel theories
- **Transparency**: Complete processing transparency for research validation

### **Negative**
- **Performance limitations**: Not optimized for high-throughput enterprise use cases
- **Scalability constraints**: Single-node design limits to researcher-scale datasets
- **Enterprise features**: Lacks enterprise monitoring, security, and infrastructure features
- **Market limitations**: Narrower user base than general-purpose enterprise tools

## Academic Research Design Implications

### **Development Priorities**
1. **Correctness validation**: Extensive testing to ensure accurate research results
2. **Provenance completeness**: Every operation fully documented for reproducibility
3. **Methodological flexibility**: Support for diverse research theories and approaches
4. **Citation integrity**: Complete source attribution for academic integrity
5. **Local deployment simplicity**: Easy setup on researcher personal/institutional computers

### **Non-Priorities (Explicitly Deprioritized)**
1. **Enterprise scalability**: High-throughput, multi-tenant architecture
2. **Production monitoring**: 24/7 uptime monitoring and alerting
3. **Enterprise security**: Complex authentication, authorization, audit systems
4. **Distributed processing**: Multi-node processing and coordination
5. **Performance optimization**: Micro-optimizations at expense of clarity

### **Feature Decisions Based on Academic Focus**

**Configuration**:
- Simple, file-based configuration over complex management systems
- Sensible defaults for academic use cases
- Clear documentation over automated configuration management

**Error Handling**:
- Fail-fast with clear error messages over graceful degradation
