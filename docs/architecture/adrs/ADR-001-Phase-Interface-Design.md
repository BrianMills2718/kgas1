# ADR-001: Contract-First Tool Interface Design (Layer 2: Internal Contract)

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Partially Implemented - 10 tools use legacy interfaces, 9 tools have unified interface, contract-first design remains architectural goal  
**Deciders**: Development Team  
**Context**: Tool integration failures due to incompatible interfaces  
**Layer**: **Layer 2 - Internal Contract Interface** (see [ADR-028](ADR-028-Tool-Interface-Layer-Architecture.md) for complete layer architecture)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Decision**

**Use contract-first design for all tool interfaces with theory schema integration**

This ADR defines **Layer 2 (Internal Contract Interface)** in the [three-layer tool interface architecture](ADR-028-Tool-Interface-Layer-Architecture.md). All tools must implement standardized contracts with theory schema support to enable agent-orchestrated workflows and cross-modal analysis.

**Layer 2 Scope**: Internal KGAS services, agent orchestration, cross-modal analysis, theory integration

---

## ðŸš¨ **Problem**

### **Current Issues**
- **API Incompatibility**: Tools have different calling signatures and return formats
- **Integration Failures**: Tools tested in isolation, breaks discovered at agent runtime
- **No Theory Integration**: Theoretical concepts defined but not consistently used in processing
- **Agent Complexity**: Agent needs complex logic to handle different tool interfaces

### **Root Cause**
- **"Build First, Integrate Later"**: Tools built independently without shared contracts
- **No Interface Standards**: Each tool evolved its own API without coordination
- **Missing Theory Awareness**: Processing pipeline doesn't consistently use theoretical foundations

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Trade-off Analysis**

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Keep Status Quo (Tool-Specific Interfaces)
- **Pros**:
  - No migration effort required
  - Tools remain independent and specialized
  - Developers familiar with existing patterns
  - Quick to add new tools without constraints
  
- **Cons**:
  - Integration complexity grows exponentially with tool count
  - Agent orchestration requires complex adapter logic
  - No consistent error handling or confidence tracking
  - Theory integration would require per-tool implementation
  - Testing each tool combination separately

#### Option 2: Retrofit with Adapters
- **Pros**:
  - Preserve existing tool implementations
  - Gradual migration possible
  - Lower initial development effort
  - Can maintain backward compatibility
  
- **Cons**:
  - Adapter layer adds performance overhead
  - Theory integration still difficult
  - Two patterns to maintain (native + adapted)
  - Technical debt accumulates
  - Doesn't solve root cause of integration issues

#### Option 3: Contract-First Design [SELECTED]
- **Pros**:
  - Clean, consistent interfaces across all tools
  - Theory integration built into contract
  - Enables intelligent agent orchestration
  - Simplified testing and validation
  - Future tools automatically compatible
  - Cross-modal analysis becomes straightforward
  
- **Cons**:
  - Significant refactoring of existing tools
  - Higher upfront design effort
  - Team learning curve for new patterns
  - Risk of over-engineering contracts

#### Option 4: Microservice Architecture
- **Pros**:
  - Tools completely decoupled
  - Independent scaling and deployment
  - Technology agnostic (tools in any language)
  - Industry-standard pattern
  
- **Cons**:
  - Massive complexity increase for research platform
  - Network overhead for local processing
  - Distributed system challenges
  - Overkill for single-user academic use case

### Decision Rationale

Contract-First Design (Option 3) was selected because:

1. **Agent Enablement**: Standardized interfaces are essential for intelligent agent orchestration of tool workflows.

2. **Theory Integration**: Built-in support for theory schemas ensures consistent application of domain knowledge.

3. **Cross-Modal Requirements**: Consistent interfaces enable seamless conversion between graph, table, and vector representations.

4. **Research Quality**: Standardized confidence scoring and provenance tracking improve research reproducibility.

5. **Long-term Maintenance**: While initial effort is higher, the reduced integration complexity pays dividends over time.

6. **Testing Efficiency**: Integration tests can validate tool combinations systematically rather than ad-hoc.

### When to Reconsider

This decision should be revisited if:
- Moving from research platform to production service
- Need to integrate external tools not under our control
- Performance overhead of contracts exceeds 10%
- Team size grows beyond 5 developers
- Requirements shift from batch to real-time processing

The contract abstraction provides flexibility to evolve the implementation while maintaining interface stability.

## **Selected Solution**

### **Contract-First Tool Interface**
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ToolRequest:
    """Immutable contract for ALL tool inputs"""
    input_data: Any
    theory_schema: Optional[TheorySchema] = None
    concept_library: Optional[MasterConceptLibrary] = None
    options: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    
@dataclass(frozen=True)  
class ToolResult:
    """Immutable contract for ALL tool outputs"""
    status: Literal["success", "error"]
    data: Any
    confidence: ConfidenceScore  # From ADR-004
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    provenance: ProvenanceRecord

class KGASTool(ABC):
    """Contract all tools MUST implement"""
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, request: ToolRequest) -> ToolResult:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_theory_compatibility(self) -> List[str]:
        """Return list of theory schema names this tool supports"""
        
    @abstractmethod 
    def get_input_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return JSON schema for expected input_data format"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def get_output_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return JSON schema for returned data format"""
```

### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Phase A**: Define tool contracts and create wrappers for existing tools
2. **Phase B**: Implement theory integration and confidence scoring (ADR-004)
3. **Phase C**: Migrate tools to native contract implementation
4. **Phase D**: Enable agent orchestration and cross-modal workflows
