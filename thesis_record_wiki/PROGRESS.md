# Mission: Thesis Record Wiki

## Objective

Build a Karpathy-style wiki over Brian's KGAS / Digimons / PhD thesis record so the full messy historical evolution is preserved, navigable, and auditable without modifying the raw archive.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Raw preservation material under `archive_full_record/` is not moved, deleted, repaired, or rewritten during wiki work.
- [ ] Every ingest creates or updates source/concept/entity/variant pages with citations to immutable source paths.
- [ ] Large source bundles are split into bounded slices before synthesis.
- [ ] `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, and `raw/source_manifest.md` stay current.
- [ ] The wiki linter reports `100/100` before each commit.
- [ ] Each verified ingest slice is committed and pushed.

## Constraints

- Treat the wiki as derived navigation and synthesis, not ground truth.
- Preserve both positive evidence and negative evidence; do not make the thesis look cleaner or more successful than the sources warrant.
- Broken `.git` worktree pointers are provenance facts, not repair tasks, unless Brian explicitly requests recovery.
- Recommend the next step after every completed slice.

## Current Phase

Continue bounded ingest of `archive_full_record/lineage_variants/digimon_lineage_Digimons`, moving from lit-review Phase 2-3 evidence into either Phase 4-6 operational evidence or architecture ADR topical sub-slices.

## Completed

- `5c32569` initialized the thesis record wiki.
- `97a3fb7` ingested `Digimons_docs`, `Digimons_minimal`, and `Digimons_clean_for_real/tool_compatability`.
- `78e0f90` ingested JayLZhou GraphRAG upstream lineage and `digimon_core_sparse`.
- `901461d` ingested `digimon_autoloop`, including adaptive operator routing, MCP/autoloop interface, graph build manifest, negative MuSiQue dev evidence, and broken worktree pointer provenance.
- `dba77e8` ingested first `digimon_lineage_Digimons` root-state slice, including source summary, reality-verification arc, vertical-slice/main-system split, and progress tracker.
- `41fcead` ingested `digimon_lineage_Digimons/tool_compatability`, including large-bundle source summary and updates to type-based composition.
- `871f7e9` ingested `digimon_lineage_Digimons/docs/architecture` top-level slice, including architecture source summary and uncertainty traceability concept.
- `bf80bf9` ingested the evidence archive slice, including false-claim correction and evidence validation-level concept.
- `54d1422` ingested first `experiments/lit_review` slice, including automated theory extraction source summary, schema/application method concept, and validation-claim caveats.
- `c780da3` ingested `experiments/lit_review/carter_analysis_output`, including concrete generated output artifacts and multi-theory application artifact concept.
- `603f173` ingested `experiments/lit_review/src/schema_creation`, including prompt structure, information-loss fix, v13 extractors, and schema extraction pipeline evolution concept.
- `e006732` ingested `experiments/lit_review/validation_results`, including Young/framing/Lofland reports, selected baseline outputs, and complexity/accuracy pattern concept.
- Pending commit: lit-review Phase 2-3 evidence slice, including vocabulary/schema balance claims, stored test outputs, and Phase 2 summary/test contradiction.

## Next

1. Run wiki lint, commit, and push the Phase 2-3 evidence slice.
2. Next recommended ingest slice: `experiments/lit_review/evidence/phase4_integration_pipeline`, because production-readiness claims are high-risk and should be handled one phase at a time.
3. Later slices: Phase 5 reasoning engine, Phase 6 production validation, `docs/architecture/adrs/`, `experiments/lit_review/multi_agent_system/`, and UI/recovered components.
